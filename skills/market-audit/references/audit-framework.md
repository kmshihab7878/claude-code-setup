# Audit framework (Phase 1 detail)

Full 6-row business-type detection table (SaaS/E-commerce/Agency/Local/Creator/Marketplace with signals + analysis focus) and the key-page identification list. SKILL.md keeps the 6 business-type names with one-line focus; this file holds the full detection-signal detail and site-architecture map.

| **Local Business** | Address, phone number, hours, "near me", Google Maps embed | Local SEO, Google Business Profile, reviews, NAP consistency |
| **Creator/Course** | Lead magnets, email capture, course listings, community links | Email capture rate, funnel design, testimonials, content quality |
