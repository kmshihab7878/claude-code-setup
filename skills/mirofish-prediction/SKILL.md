# MiroFish Scenario Prediction

## Overview

MiroFish is a swarm intelligence engine that builds simulated digital worlds from
real-world seed data. Thousands of agents with distinct personalities, memory, and
behavioral logic interact to produce qualitative scenario predictions.

**Complementary to TimesFM**: TimesFM gives quantitative price curves with confidence
intervals. MiroFish gives qualitative scenario narratives — what happens *if* a specific
event occurs and how it cascades through markets and public opinion.

## When to Use

- "What happens if the Fed raises rates?" — scenario simulation
- "Impact of a whale dumping 10K BTC?" — cascading effect analysis
- Public opinion modeling for token launches or policy changes
- Complementing TimesFM forecasts with narrative context
- Any council question in the trading or strategy domain
- Strategic decisions that need "what if" scenario exploration

## How to Start MiroFish

```bash
# Backend (Python 3.10, port 5001)
source ~/Projects/MiroFish/backend/.venv/bin/activate
cd ~/Projects/MiroFish && python backend/app/main.py

# Frontend (port 3002 — avoid conflict with Agent Orchestrator on 3000)
PORT=3002 npm --prefix ~/Projects/MiroFish/frontend start
```

**Prerequisites**: Real API keys in `~/Projects/MiroFish/.env`:
- `LLM_API_KEY` — OpenRouter or Claude API key
- `ZEP_API_KEY` — Zep Cloud key for agent memory

## Integration with Council

When `/council` is invoked for trading or strategy domains:

1. **Phase 0**: If MiroFish is running, seed a scenario simulation with the council question
2. Feed the simulation results as additional intelligence to the advisors
3. The **Contrarian** advisor should specifically challenge MiroFish's assumptions
4. The **Executor** should reference both TimesFM numbers and MiroFish scenarios

## Integration with /plan

When `/plan` routes a trading or strategy task:

1. Use MiroFish for "what-if" analysis before committing to a trading strategy
2. Compare MiroFish qualitative predictions against TimesFM quantitative forecasts
3. If predictions diverge significantly, escalate to council decision

## Cost Warning

Each simulation runs thousands of LLM-powered agents. A single scenario can consume
significant API tokens. Use judiciously — prefer TimesFM for routine forecasting,
reserve MiroFish for high-stakes scenario analysis.

## Combo: Full Prediction Stack

```
Aster MCP (live market data)
    → TimesFM (quantitative: price curves + confidence intervals)
    → MiroFish (qualitative: scenario narratives + cascading effects)
    → Council (multi-advisor synthesis of both)
    → autoresearch (measure prediction accuracy over time)
```
